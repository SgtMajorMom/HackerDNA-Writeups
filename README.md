## 📘 About This Repository

This repository documents my hands‑on cybersecurity learning journey through the HackerDNA platform.  
Each lab write‑up reflects my real workflow, including the commands I used, the reasoning behind each step, and the lessons I learned along the way.

My goal is to create write‑ups that are:

- **Beginner‑friendly** — clear explanations that help others follow the same path  
- **Technically accurate** — grounded in real commands, outputs, and methodology  
- **Professional** — organized, consistent, and easy for recruiters to navigate  

These labs represent my growing skill set in networking, enumeration, privilege escalation, and foundational offensive security techniques.  
They also demonstrate my ability to communicate technical concepts clearly — a key skill for Security Analysts and Junior Penetration Testers.
