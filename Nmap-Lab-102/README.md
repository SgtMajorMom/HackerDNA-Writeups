# HackerDNA Learning Labs — Writeups by Dorothy Spencer

Welcome to my collection of cybersecurity learning lab write-ups completed through the HackerDNA platform.  
This repository documents my hands‑on practice across networking, enumeration, privilege escalation, and foundational offensive security concepts.

My goal is to create clear, beginner‑friendly, technically accurate write-ups that demonstrate my workflow, reinforce my learning, and help others who are starting their cybersecurity journey.

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here

Each folder contains:
- A structured lab writeup (Markdown or DOCX)
- Commands used during the lab
- Screenshots (when applicable)
- Key takeaways and lessons learned

These writeups reflect my actual troubleshooting process, including:
- Enumeration steps  
- Missteps and corrections  
- Clear explanations of why each command matters  
- Practical notes for beginners

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repo serves three goals:

### **1. Professional Documentation**
Demonstrates my technical workflow, clarity of thought, and ability to communicate security concepts effectively.

### **2. Personal Learning**
Writing things down reinforces my understanding and helps me track my progress across labs.

### **3. Community Support**
I aim to make these write-ups accessible for beginners who may be working through the same labs.

## 🧠 My Approach

I follow a consistent methodology across all labs:

1. **Enumerate first** — gather information before acting  
2. **Validate assumptions** — avoid guessing  
3. **Document everything** — commands, outputs, and reasoning  
4. **Reflect** — capture lessons learned and pitfalls  
5. **Stay beginner‑friendly** — explain the “why,” not just the “what”
